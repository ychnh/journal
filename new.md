f: A-B
g: B-A
-g:
-f:
f(A)
g(B)

The issue now is that the domain of ginv that we use to fill the missing hole from f
conflicts with the domain of f.

g can start from g(B) and can fill in holes in all B
f can start from all A but can only fill holes in f(A)

so we definitely need some elements from g(B) that will be in f(A)
because we cannot use all of A to fill in all of f(A)


ok so what elements we have to use f
elements in f(A) that do not start from g(B)

ok so what remains these are the ones we must use g
elements outside of f(A)
elements in f(A) that start from g(B)


Ok so we need to clarify what you mean by start from g(B)
Ah ok so these starts are referring to mappings from f
 
by design these sets encompass A and B
and are disjoint on B
We need to show disjoint on A
1 map from g(-f(A))
