# 210120

    If the cardinality of A,B is A<B and B<A then A=B

The solution involves constructing a bijection.
I have been struggling with this one for a while.

The first point in difficulty was not knowing to go with contradiction or a direct construction.
? Should I go with contradiction or a direct construction?
? Why would one prefer one over another?
? What kind of problems have contradiction worked better than direct construction ? (vice versa)

The second point was not investigating an idea which I had further.
I had constructed an object. But I had not carefully considered it.
I had brushed it off because it seemed too complicated. 
**Such assumptions are dangerous**
? Is this a valid object?
? If not how can it be improved?
