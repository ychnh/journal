Here is a journal which I attempt to log and focus on the process of problem solving.
This marks a shift from the previous approach of logging the varying discoveries which I have encountered
to concretely breaking down the process of approach and understanding the problem at hand.

### If the cardinality of A,B is A<B and B<A then A=B

Continuing the problem. You initially proposed a simple way to construct a bijection which had some problems.
Which was f combined with ginv for a g(f(A)c), a subset of A

How can ---- change to satistfy the condition?
* This question helped me to devise a plan to modify the initial function which was not working
What is the complete set of possibilities?
* Perhaps this was a question that I should have considered earlier.
What must be true? What cannot change?
* This helped me to narrow down some connections between the two domains, leaving out some guesswork.

### a fresh start

Sometimes we all yearn for a fresh start

### A hill to die on.

Often times I think it is important to choose a good hill to die on or giveup.
Just as in working out sometimes you know when you need to stop the current approach and readjust.
Or focus on a particular point more than others.

At the same time it is really important to spend your time to really learn.
On the contrary, spending time just reading definitions and skipping far past ahead is not really ad advised course of action.
I have done this in the past and during all of my life and I have to say that it has led to some regrettable consequences
In which I have not achieved much or have done alot.
I say stick with the current course and keep going. You must endure it.

### If the cardinality of A,B is A<B and B<A then A=B

The solution involves constructing a bijection.
I have been struggling with this one for a while.

The first point in difficulty was not knowing to go with contradiction or a direct construction.
Should I go with contradiction or a direct construction?
Why would one prefer one over another?
What kind of problems have contradiction worked better than direct construction ? (vice versa)

The second point was not investigating an idea which I had further.
I had constructed an object. But I had not carefully considered it.
I had brushed it off because it seemed too complicated. And complicated things do not lead to solutions.
What makes it complicated?
Is it actually complicated?
**Such assumptions are dangerous**
What makes it complicate
Is this a valid object?
If not how can it be improved?
